# Random Data Script Generator

This project is meant to generate scripts for building and populating the tables of a database with random data based on specifications passed in by JSON files. 
The main purpose of this tool is to allow generation of random data for testing different data scenarios without having to use live data or data that is not structured like the data set you are working with.
